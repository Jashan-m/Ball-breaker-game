Ball Game
Ball Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks using a bouncing ball while controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen. It features simple yet engaging gameplay, with a scoring system and a game-over condition when the ball falls past the paddle.

Features
Paddle Control: Move the paddle horizontally with the mouse to catch and bounce the ball.
Bricks: A grid of bricks to destroy, each hit increases the player's score.
Ball Dynamics: The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks, with collision detection for all.
Scoring: Earn points for each brick destroyed.
Game Over: The game ends if the ball falls below the paddle. Press 'R' to restart the game.
